The idea is to do in order traversal of the binary tree.
While doing inorder traversal, keep track of the previously visited node in a variable, say prev. 
For every visited node, make it next to the prev and previous of this node as prev.
maintain a prev pointer

Node prev=null,head=null;
void convertToDLL(Node root){
if(root== null){return};


///inorder traversal

convertToDLL(root.left); //left recursive call

if(prev == null) {head= root}; //setting the root with leftmost element
else{
root.left =prev;
			//Creating links btwn prev and curr root element
prev.right =root;
}
prev = root; //updating the prev pointer

convertToDLL(root.right); //right recursive call
}
