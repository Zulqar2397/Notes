//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
METHOD 1 (Simple):  

Approach: Traverse through the array, and for every index,
find the number of smaller elements on its right side of the array.
This can be done using a nested loop.
Sum up the counts for all index in the array and print the sum.

Algorithm:

Traverse through the array from start to end
For every element, find the count of elements smaller than the current number up to that index using another loop.
Sum up the count of inversion for every index.
Print the count of inversions.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
METHOD 2(Enhance Merge Sort): 

Approach: 
Suppose the number of inversions in the left half and right half of the array (let be inv1 and inv2);
what kinds of inversions are not accounted for in Inv1 + Inv2? 
The answer is – the inversions that need to be counted during the merge step.
Therefore, to get the total number of inversions that needs to be added are
 the number of inversions in the left subarray, right subarray, and merge().


How to get the number of inversions in merge()? 
In merge process, let i is used for indexing left sub-array and j for right sub-array.
At any step in merge(), if a[i] is greater than a[j],
 then there are (mid – i) inversions. 
because left and right subarrays are sorted,
 so all the remaining elements in left-subarray (a[i+1], a[i+2] … a[mid]) will be greater than a[j]
{1,2,3(i),4,5} {1,2(j)}
3>2 so 3,4,5 would also be greater

///
Algorithm: 

The idea is similar to merge sort,
divide the array into two equal or almost equal halves in each step until the base case is reached.
Create a function merge that counts the number of inversions when two halves of the array are merged,
create two indices i and j, i is the index for the first half, and j is an index of the second half.
if a[i] is greater than a[j], then there are (mid – i) inversions.
because left and right subarrays are sorted,
so all the remaining elements in left-subarray (a[i+1], a[i+2] … a[mid]) will be greater than a[j].
Create a recursive function to divide the array into halves and
find the answer by summing the number of inversions is the first half,
			   the number of inversion in the second half and 
			   the number of inversions by merging the two.
The base case of recursion is when there is only one element in the given half.
